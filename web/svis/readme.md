Sensor data visualizer

## Thoughts
- TCP server in android HAL to stream sensor data
- use adb for port forwarding
- node app in PC that talks to the device
- js client app that runs in browser. This acts as visualization front-end

need to enable "Override software rendering list" in chrome://flags to get WEBGL working with p5.js
on chrome
