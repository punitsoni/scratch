# scratch
This is a scratch-pad repo that I use to store quick hacks and test out new concepts. Most of the stuff here can be completely unrelated to one another. You may find snippets ranging from Linux kernel device drivers, to web applications, games, automation scripts, hello-world style projects in many languages, skeleton projects, tips on best practices etc.

Have fun Hacking!
