use "npm start" to start the development server.
This starts a webpack-dev-server which will act as
a proxy for our actual API server (server.js)

Use localhost:3000 from the client to open the react app
application

webpack dev server has an issue where it consumes very high

macOs it to 

    npm install fsevents
